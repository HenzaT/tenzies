## Tenzies (Scrimba React Project)
This is a self-directed project. This is a project intended to consolidate my ongoing learning of React.js through the Scrimba course on React. 

## Goals
I have been learning React through a course on Scrimba. One of the projects towards the end is to build a tenzies game. 

## Tech Stack
- React.js
- Vite

## Process
I first set up my React project using Vite: 

`npm create vite@latest`\
Selected framework: `React`\
Selected variant: `JavaScript`\
`cd tenzies`\
`npm install`\
`npm run dev`
